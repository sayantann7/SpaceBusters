# SpaceBusters

SpaceBusters is a 2D space shooting game built using Python's Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a spaceship and shoots enemies while avoiding enemy bullets. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by defeating enemies.

## Features

- **Player Control**: Move the playerâ€™s spaceship left and right.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Fire bullets from the player's spaceship to destroy enemy ships.
- **Enemy Ships**: The game includes multiple enemy ships that move on the screen and fire bullets.
- **Score System**: Earn points by destroying enemy ships. Your score is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
- **High Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of your highest score, saving it to a text file.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the final score and allows the player to restart the game or quit.
- **Background Music and Sound Effects**: Background music plays during the game, and sound effects play when bullets are fired.
